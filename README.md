# marko-math

This is a math library written in C++20 by Marko Vujnovic. The main difference of this library, compared to other ones, is that it doesn't force you to use its types but is instead meant to be used with whatever math types you are already using. While this approach has obvious advantages it also comes with the small inconvenience that you are required to write a small amount of glue code so that your types fulfill the necessary concepts. 

This library is dual-licensed under commercial and open source licenses. The commercial license gives you the full rights to create and distribute software on your own terms without any open source license obligations. The library is also available under the terms of the GPLv2 open source license. The open source license is ideal for use cases such as open source projects with open source distribution, student/academic purposes, hobby projects, internal research projects without external distribution, or other projects where all GPLv2 obligations can be met.
